## 3. Configuration and Description

### Configuring Obfuscation Scripts

Before building the APK, configure the obfuscation configuration file to prevent the HMS Core SDK from being obfuscated.

**NOTE**: This step is required only if you want to minify and obfuscate your app. By default obfuscation is disabled in Cordova and Ionic apps.

The obfuscation is done by **ProGuard.** By default, in Cordova and Ionic apps ProGuard is disabled. Even though ProGuard is not available, ProGuard support can be added through 3rd party ProGuard plugins. If ProGuard is enabled in your project, the Huawei Cordova Ads plugin's ProGuard rules need to be added to your project. These rules are as follows:

```text
-ignorewarnings
-keepattributes *Annotation*
-keepattributes Exceptions
-keepattributes InnerClasses
-keepattributes Signature
-keep class com.huawei.hianalytics.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.updatesdk.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.hms.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.hms.ads.**{*;}
-keep interface com.huawei.hms.ads.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.openalliance.ad.**{*;}
-repackageclasses
```
