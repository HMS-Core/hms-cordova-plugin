## 1. Introduction

This demo application demonstrates the usage of the HMS Health Kit Cordova plugin.

---

## 2. Installation Guide

Before you get started, you must register as a HUAWEI Developer and complete identity verification on the [HUAWEI Developer](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en?ha_source=hms1) website. For details, please refer to [Register a HUAWEI ID](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/10104?ha_source=hms1).

### 2.1. Creating a Project in AppGallery Connect

Creating an app in AppGallery Connect is required in order to communicate with the Huawei services. To create an app, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html?ha_source=hms1) and select **My projects**.
2. Select your project from the project list or create a new one by clicking the **Add Project** button.
3. Go to **Project Setting** > **General information**, and click **Add app**.
   - If an app exists in the project and you need to add a new one, expand the app selection area on the top of the page and click **Add app**.
4. On the **Add app** page, enter the app information, and click **OK**.

### 2.2. Configuring the Signing Certificate Fingerprint

A signing certificate fingerprint is used to verify the authenticity of an app when it attempts to access an HMS Core (APK) through the HMS SDK. Before using the HMS Core (APK), you must locally generate a signing certificate fingerprint and configure it in the **AppGallery Connect**. You can refer to 3rd and 4th steps of [Generating a Signing Certificate](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html?ha_source=hms1#2) Codelab tutorial for the certificate generation.

### 2.3. Enabling Required Services

#### Applying for Health Kit

To use HUAWEI Health Kit, you first need to [apply for Huawei Health Service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/apply-kitservice-0000001050071707-V5?ha_source=hms1) and also [apply for Huawei ID Service](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/apply-id-0000001050069756-V5?ha_source=hms1).

1. Sign in to the HUAWEI Developers website and click Console.

2. Click Health Kit in Development section.

3. Click Apply for Health Kit, agree to the agreement, and the screen for data permission application is displayed.

4. Select the data access permissions that must be applied for the product.

   - When adding Health Kit, comply with the least privilege principle. The data access permissions must be consistent with the business. Do not apply for any permission that is beyond the business scope or is not yet needed.

5. Wait while your application is under approval.

   - It normally takes about 15 minutes for an application involving data types other than restricted ones to be automatically activated. If permissions for restricted data types are required, the application will be subject to approval. For applications that involve the write permissions of restricted data types, the approval process may take a couple of weeks, depending on the number of data types for which permissions are required and the app release regions.

   - An application won't be approved if the submitted materials do not meet the requirements. Once the application is approved, the app development and test phases can start and the app can be released once the related procedures are completed.

   - If your business scope changes and you need to modify the corresponding data permissions, click Modify to submit the application again.

> **NOTE:** Please save the public key obtained during the process of enabling the IAP service. It will be used for verifying the signature of data returned by the IAP SDK, ensuring that the data is not tampered with.

## 3. Configuration and Description

Please make sure you have applied and get accepted for Huawei Health Service.

### Configuring Obfuscation Scripts

Before building the APK, configure the obfuscation configuration file to prevent the HMS Core SDK from being obfuscated.

**NOTE**: This step is required only if you want to minify and obfuscate your app. By default obfuscation is disabled in Cordova and Ionic apps.

The obfuscation is done by **ProGuard.** By default, in Cordova and Ionic apps ProGuard is disabled. Even though ProGuard is not available, ProGuard support can be added through 3rd party ProGuard plugins. If ProGuard is enabled in your project, the Huawei Cordova Health plugin's ProGuard rules need to be added to your project. These rules are as follows:

```text
-ignorewarnings
-keepattributes *Annotation*
-keepattributes Exceptions
-keepattributes InnerClasses
-keepattributes Signature
-keep class com.huawei.hianalytics.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.updatesdk.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.hms.**{*;}
-repackageclasses
```
