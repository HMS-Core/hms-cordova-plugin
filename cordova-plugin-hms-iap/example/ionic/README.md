## 1. Introduction

This demo application demonstrates the usage of the HMS IAP Cordova plugin.

---

## 2. Installation Guide

Before you get started, you must register as a HUAWEI Developer and complete identity verification
on the [HUAWEI Developer](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/?ha_source=hms1) website. For
details, please refer
to [Register a HUAWEI ID](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/10104?ha_source=hms1).

### 2.1. Creating a Project in AppGallery Connect

Creating an app in AppGallery Connect is required in order to communicate with the Huawei services.
To create an app, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in
   to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html?ha_source=hms1)
   and select **My projects**.
2. Select your project from the project list or create a new one by clicking the **Add Project**
   button.
3. Go to **Project Setting** > **General information**, and click **Add app**.
    - If an app exists in the project and you need to add a new one, expand the app selection area
      on the top of the page and click **Add app**.
4. On the **Add app** page, enter the app information, and click **OK**.

### 2.2. Configuring the Signing Certificate Fingerprint and Obtaining agconnect-services.json

A signing certificate fingerprint is used to verify the authenticity of an app when it attempts to
access an HMS Core (APK) through the HMS SDK. Before using the HMS Core (APK), you must locally
generate a signing certificate fingerprint and configure it in the **AppGallery Connect**. You can
refer to 3rd and 4th steps
of [Generating a Signing Certificate](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/codelab/HMSPreparation/index.html#2?ha_source=hms1)
Codelab tutorial for the certificate generation. Perform the following steps after you have
generated the certificate.

1. Sign in
   to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html?ha_source=hms1)
   and select your project from **My Projects**. Then go to **Project Setting** > **General
   information**. In the **App information** field, click the icon next to SHA-256 certificate
   fingerprint, and enter the obtained **SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**.
2. After completing the configuration, click **OK** to save the changes. (Check mark icon)
3. In the same page, click **agconnect-services.json** button to download the configuration file.

### 2.3. Ionic

## 3. Configuration and Description

### Configuring Obfuscation Scripts

Before building the APK, configure the obfuscation configuration file to prevent the HMS Core SDK
from being obfuscated.

**NOTE**: This step is required only if you want to minify and obfuscate your app. By default
obfuscation is disabled in Cordova and Ionic apps.

The obfuscation is done by **ProGuard.** By default, in Cordova and Ionic apps ProGuard is disabled.
Even though ProGuard is not available, ProGuard support can be added through 3rd party ProGuard
plugins. If ProGuard is enabled in your project, the Huawei Cordova IAP plugin's ProGuard rules need
to be added to your project. These rules are as follows:

```text
-ignorewarnings
-keepattributes *Annotation*
-keepattributes Exceptions
-keepattributes InnerClasses
-keepattributes Signature
-keep class com.huawei.hianalytics.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.updatesdk.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.hms.**{*;}
-repackageclasses
```
